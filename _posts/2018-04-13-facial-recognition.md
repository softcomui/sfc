Nowadays, we are observing more cameras in our society. They are present in quite a lot of places: streets, supermarkets, churches, mosques and many other public places across Nigeria. The primary aim of their presence is most of the time related to surveillance and security management.

With Facial recognition being one of the blow-the-trumpet features to come to smart devices and with the IPhone X gaining quite some popularity amongst phone users in Nigeria, FR technology is definitely here to positively disrupt the process of achieving identity management and even payment in the Nigerian fin-tech space.

### How Does FR Actually work?   
FR algorithms simply extract facial information from a person’s face and analyses these features against a set of rules previously set up within the algorithm. The most popular face recognition method (Three-Dimensional Recognition) uses 3D sensors to determine certain facial information — face structure, chin, nose and eye sockets and compares it against a previously saved copy of the image on a phone or a database.

For example, Apple’s Face ID on the iPhone X “uses a ‘TrueDepth’ camera setup, which blasts your face with more than 30,000 infrared dots and scans your face in 3D. A portion of the A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine transforms the depth map and infrared image into a mathematical representation and compares that representation to the enrolled facial data.” This method helps the smartphone make a quick decision on if the person holding the phone to his or her face truly owns the phone.

**Access Management:** With facial recognition, organizations can easily manage entrance and exit at their business locations, achieve optimum staff identity management, attendance monitoring and surveillance on business premises.

### Your cameras are becoming part of your Marketing Team   
> Large retail businesses can access insightful customer information by capturing the facial data of customers that visit their stores.

**Data Analytics:** For example, a shopper goes to ShopRite, Maryland Mall and makes several purchases of a specific brand of chocolate over the course of 1 month. ShopRite can store these vital biometric information which may give quite some insight into a customer’s in-store purchasing behaviour, demographics, psychographics etc. With access to this type of data, businesses can make more informed marketing decisions like simply offering him discount on many purchases of his favourite chocolate or presenting him with loyalty schemes etc.

**Identity Management:** Examination bodies like UTME, IELTS and TOEFL can also utilize facial recognition in managing various attendees’ identity in physical or online examinations. FR can also be used in checking travelers at airports and boarding stations.In the United States, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recently launched a facial check-in feature at airports.This was piloted a few weeks ago at the Los Angeles LAX airport. With this feature, travelers can literally walk the check-in aisle and get checked-in via facial recognition.

Between January and September 2017, [Nigeria’s airports](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/253834-nigerian-airports-record-9-2-million-passengers-140552-aircraft-movement-nine-months.html "Placeholder") recorded 9.2 million flights in 140,552 aircraft movements . With this high amount of travellers flying within and outside Nigeria, an investment in FR technology by Nigeria’s NCAA, FAAN will ensure a seamless check-in and boarding process at all airports in Nigeria.

### Are We Amped About What We’re Building? Yes!   
Building solutions that add value to people and businesses is an important part of the things we do at Softcom. In the coming weeks, we’ll be launching one of our fin-tech products aimed at helping our potential users achieve seamless payments via their telephone numbers and more importantly approving payments via facial recognition. With the FR algorithm, users can easily achieve payments by simply placing their mobile devices against their faces to authorize payments at a brick and mortar shopping store or online when.
